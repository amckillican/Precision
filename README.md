## About
This is essentially an app that will help train your hand eye coordination with a mouse, and your reaction time. The game consists of reaction time test, and an aim trainer where you click targets as they appear, there will be 3 levels of difficulties for the aim trainer.

## Motivation
This project exists for a computer science class CPT

## Code style
We will use pygame to set up the game, and we will have a random number generator to decide the time it takes for the person to react and measure that time. We will also use a random number generator to randomly place targets and measure the time it takes to hit the next target. We will use for loops to iterate through the user's inputs. We determine if a target needs to be displayed or if a key is being pressed based on the for loop. We will make use of functions to make our code easier to read and more concise.
