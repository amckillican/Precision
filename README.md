## About
This is essentially an app that will help train your hand eye coordination with a mouse, and your reaction time. The game consists of reaction time test and an aim trainer where you click targets as they appear, there will be 3 levels of difficulties for the aim trainer.

## Motivation
This project exists for a computer science class CPT

## Code style
We will use pygame to setup the game, and we will have a random number generator to decide the time it takes for the person to be prompted to react and use a time module to measure that time. We will write to a text file to store the best times and average times. We will also use a random number generator to randomly place targets and the time module to measure the time it takes to hit the next target. We will, again, store these values in a text file to keep track of them, and display them.
